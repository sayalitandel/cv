        Following my interest, I took up a Bachelor of Computer Engineering as a
        career via <a href="https://mu.ac.in/"> Mumbai University.</a>
      </li>

        During Computer Engineering, I willingly chose a sensitive topic to help

          I aimed to curb intermediaries and promote the Producer-to-Consumers

          certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more
          to build.

      <li>And for this, I am very grateful.</li>
